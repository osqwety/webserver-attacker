# webserver-attacker
Attacks web servers hosted on LAN
---------------------------------

**This program requires nmap and arpspoof to be installed on the system.* The idea of this program is to set it to run automatically on startup.
When this is done, plugging in Ethernet and power will automatically start the attack.

*Steps to automatically run*
- Create a systemd service file that automatically runs this script as root
- Tell systemd to use this script
----------------------------------
More info on this will come soon, i am lazy rn
